    features:
      - Extracting tables from local and online pdf files
    genericName: R + Shiny app
    localisedName: rpdf
    longDescription: |
      A very simple tool to extract tables from local and online pdf files. Just point to the web address of a pdf file or upload your local pdf file and wait for the 
      renderer to show it in the preview. Then choose the table you'd like to extract as simple text and just enter the progressive number of the table in the file (for example
      in order to extract the second table of a local pdf file just write the number 2).
      The app is made in R and deployed using Shiny server. A working example can be found here:
